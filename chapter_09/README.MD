# Chapter 9

In this chapter and beyond the code changes dramatically. All of the chapters up to chapter 9 use a single type of object, `Sphere`. From this chapter on the book introduces different objects, `plane`, `cube`, `cylinder`. I accomplished this in Rust by using traits, trait objects, and boxing instances of these objects. Chapter 9 and 10 are the core reason why this repo shows each chapter as a stand alone projects. If this repo was the end result of working through all of the chapters than it would not represent chapters prior to 9 in a reasonably way because all chapters prior to 9 would not have a single type Sphere the code would use the trait and trait object which might be confusing.
